ABSTRACT

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Desperadito package.
Desperadito is an open source library of object-oriented software components
written in C++. It implements design patterns that the author has found to be
both useful in embedded applications, both Linux-based and otherwise. Code from
Desperadito (and it's pre-fork predecessor Desperado) has legitimately found its
way into the commercial products of several of the Corporation's clients. So
don't be surprised if you see this code popping up elsewhere in your travels.

Desperadito is a mashup of code from the Digital Aggregates projects Desperado
and Hayloft with the build framework from Diminuto. Desperado, Hayloft, and
Diminuto each have very different unit test frameworks; I have not made any
attempt to reconcile or rationalize them in Desperadito.

It is licensed under a modified GNU Lesser General Public License to allow it
to be incorporated into proprietary software or firmware without restriction or
viral licensing implication.
